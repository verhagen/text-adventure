# Behavior-Driven Development

Within this project [Behavior-Driven Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development)
principles are applied.

A nice introduction about [Behavioural specifications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development#Behavioural_specifications)
is a good starting point for getting the idea.


## Implementation

At the moment this project also functions as a test case for the BDD libraries 
[JBehave](http://jbehave.org/) and  
[Cucumber for Java](http://cukes.info/).

- Maven module [text-adventure-cucumber](https://github.com/verhagen/text-adventure)
